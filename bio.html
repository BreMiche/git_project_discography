			<h1> About the Artist </h1>
			<article>
				<p>
					Nujabes, born as Seba Jun, was a Japanese record producer and DJ. He made major contributions to the hip hop community through jazz-infused beats and melodies that are nostalgic
					and immersed in feel-good rhythms. His style also brings in the skill of featured American rappers such as Cise Starr and Substantial, and he was a key composer of the Samurai Champloo
					Soundtrack, an anime taking place in Feudal Japan yet adopting modern-day hip hop themes. His style is in a league of his own, and he created three studiio albums, two soundtracks and two compilations
					under his own company Hydeout Productions. He died in February of 2010 at the age of 36. Since then people have continued to shared and enjoy his music and show a side of hip hop many have not seen before.
